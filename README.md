# Scientific Calculator using AWT

Welcome to the **Scientific Calculator using AWT** repository! This project demonstrates a simple calculator application built using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) in Java. It's designed to provide a basic user interface for performing various arithmetic operations and scientific calculations.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced scientific functions such as square roots, exponentiation, and trigonometric calculations.
- User-friendly graphical interface built with AWT.

## Output
Below is a screenshot of the calculator in action:

## How to Run the Application

To get the calculator up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Java is Installed**: 
   Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if it's not already installed.

2. **Create the Java File**: 
   Create a new file named `AwtCalculator.java` on your system. This file will contain the source code for the calculator.

3. **Add the Source Code**:
   Copy the Java source code for the calculator into the `AwtCalculator.java` file. This code is responsible for the functionality and user interface of the calculator.

4. **Compile the Java File**:
   Open your command line or terminal, navigate to the directory where `AwtCalculator.java` is located, and run the following command to compile the file: `javac AwtCalculator.java`
5. **Run the Application**: Once the file is compiled successfully, you can run the calculator using the following command: `java AwtCalculator`
